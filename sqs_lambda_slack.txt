I need you to do the following:
1. Write php/laravel service that will send a message to AWS SQS using php SqSClient with the following parameters: Text (String), EventType (enum), ErrorCode (int). Include the composer dependencies in composer.json. Include Service provider configuration code
2. Write a set up instructions how to initialize SQS (if needed) and make it ready to accept for the messages from the step 1. Include AWS json security policies configuration
3. Write AWS Lambda that will listen for the SQS from the step 2 and send a slack message to a #channel whenever a new message comes in the queue. Use NodeJS 18.x runtime, include security policies configs
